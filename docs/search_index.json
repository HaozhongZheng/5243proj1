Haozhong Zheng Section 1 Introduction Sophies World is the novel from Jostein Gaarder. It is one of the most famous novels that introduce the history of philosophy. In this project, I choose some of the most famous philosophers listed as follows: Aristotle Derrida Hegel Heidegger Kant Locke Marx Nietzsche Plato Quine Russel Smith Wittgenstein In the first two section, I will conduct the sentimental analysis and topic modeling to these philosophers word to see the cluster plot of them. After that, I choose six chapters from Sophies World, each introduced a philosopher. (Plato, Aristotle, Locke, Kant, Hegel, Marx). I generate the word cloud using philosophy data and text data from Sophies World to see if there are any similarities or differences.

From the plot, trust is the emotion that appear the most in this groups of philosophers. This explain why trust is one of the most important motions to the development of world and society. Interestingly, positive word seems to appear more frequently than negative words. This is also comes with our recognition that philosophy gives us meaningful and enlightening message. 2.2 Cluster plot From the above plot, positive emotion such as trust is grouped with emotions with the same direction, like joy and anticipation. The same comes with negative emotions. The cluster plot gives us the cluster of emotions of philosophers. Most of the philosopher were in one group except for Nietzsche, who is famous for criticizing European religion. Most of his word may contain negative emotions, which may make him obviously different from the others.

Life Belong People Consiousness Nature Understanding Innovation From the plot, life and nature are two of the most important topics generated by LDA. Understanding and belong, which are consciousness of people, are the least important topics. 3.2 Cluster plot From the cluster plot, Smith and Marx, who are the authors of The Wealth of Nations and Das Kapital, have more in common in topics. Plato and Aristotle focus more on topics about people, they are in the same cluster. Quine, Russell and Wittgenstein are from school of analytic, that is why they are relative close to each other. Both Kant and Hegel are from German idealism, which explain they are in the same group.
